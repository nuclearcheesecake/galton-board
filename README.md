# galton-board

The Galton Board is a contraption invented by Sir Francis Galton in 1876 to demonstrate the central limit theorem. The device uses pegs and cascading balls to show how randomness in nature can still result in a Normal Distrubution.

### Installing the program:

You can navigate to the "galton.cpp" file and download it directly from GitHub, or type the following in your terminal:

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/nuclearcheesecake/galton-board
```

to copy the file into whichever directory you want the program.

### Running the code
  
As usual with C++ programs in UNIX, you first have to compile the program manually. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file and enter:

```shell
    g++ galton.cpp
```

There now exists a file containing the machine code named "a.out". Run the program by entering:

```shell
    ./a.out
```

Alternatively (and users outside of UNIX) you can run it from any IDE that supports the C++ language.
