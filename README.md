# galton-board

The Galton Board is a contraption invented by Sir Francis Galton in 1894 to demonstrate the central limit theorem. The device uses pegs and cascading balls to show how randomness in nature can still result in a Normal Distrubution.

### Installing the program:

You can navigate to the "galton.cpp" file and download it, or:

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/nuclearcheesecake/galton-board
```

in whichever directory you want the program.

### Running the code
  
First you have to compile the program. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file and enter:

```shell
    g++ galton.cpp
```

There now exists a file containing the machine code named "a.out". Run the program by entering:

```shell
    ./a.out
```
